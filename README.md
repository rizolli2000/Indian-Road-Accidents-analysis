# Indian-Road-Accidents-analysis
This project aims to analyze road accident data in India using Python. It utilizes various Python libraries and data analysis techniques to gain insights into road accidents, contributing factors, and potential solutions to improve road safety.

The main objectives of the project include:

Data Collection: Mostly collected data from open sources sites like kaggle and also attached the csv data set in the repository
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform necessary data transformations and feature engineering to make the dataset suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain insights into various aspects of road accidents in India. This may involve visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the dataset that could potentially contribute to road accidents. These features may include factors such as road type, vehicle speed, driver age, and presence of traffic signals.

Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms to identify factors that contribute to road accidents. This could involve techniques such as regression, classification, or clustering, depending on the specific analysis goals.

Visualization: Create interactive visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to present the analysis results effectively. Visualizations can help communicate important insights and make the analysis more accessible to a wider audience.

Recommendations: Based on the analysis findings, propose recommendations and potential solutions to address road accidents in India. This may involve suggestions for infrastructure improvements, awareness campaigns, stricter law enforcement, or driver education programs.

The project will be implemented using Python programming language and relevant libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The code, datasets, and analysis results will be shared on GitHub, allowing other researchers, data scientists, and policymakers to review, replicate, and contribute to the project.

By analyzing road accident data in India and providing actionable insights, this project aims to contribute to the development of effective road safety measures and policies, ultimately reducing the number of accidents and saving lives.
